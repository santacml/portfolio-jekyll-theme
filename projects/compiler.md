title: 'Hello_Compiler'

One of the projects I'm most proud of completing was building a full compiler, by hand.

It was built for the class EECE6083 at my university, and taught me many valuable lessons. From my summary report: "Building a compiler has been an arduous journey that both took away some of the magicof programming while also introducing new magic that, for me, is best left untouched."

The project taught me many things - making design decisions (my compiler was very different than ones built by others), how to scale, keeping track of what is left to do, of course what makes up a compiler, to name a few. The class itself also let me give my first-ever lecture as part of the course requirements, which I did on LR parsing.

All of the code is available on my github, [located here](https://github.com/santacml/Hello_Compiler). The compiler was designed to take in a language designed by the professor specifically for the class, so it is a pretty bad language that I'd never recommend for any case other than compiler-building. If you desire, however, instructions for running it are included as well as the language specifications (provided by the professor).
