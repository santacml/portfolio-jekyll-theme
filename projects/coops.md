At the University of Cincinnati, we do Co-Ops every other semester. I've gotten the chance to work at some great companies, so here are my experiences from most to least recent!

Content coming soon!

#### Intuit, San Diego (May 2018 - August 2018)

During this summer, I had the opportunity to work with Intuit.

In fact, it's still in progress, so I will get back to this one!

#### GE Aviation, Grand Rapids (August 2017 - December 2017)

Being a Computer Engineering undergrad, I get excited about hardware. Getting the chance to work with the avionics inside the 777x jet, then, was a fascinating and challenging experience. My role was to be a Systems Engineering intern, performing integration and verification, which meant spending a lot of time in the lab with the hardware. Here are some highlights:

* Integrated computing systems for the Boeing 777x commercial jet within lab environment
* Streamlined common lab processes through automation with C# and Python, saving hours of time for engineers
* Wrote 5 formal verification procedures to be run for credit when the system is ready for testing
* Planned and produced formal testing library in Python for automating verification procedures
* Gained ownership of ensuring legacy C++ testing tool worked and made additions to codebase


#### GE Aviation, Evendale (January 2016 - May 2016)

In this role, I was a Digital Technology Leadership Program Intern. GE has various after-schoool programs, one being DTLP which is focused on some intersection between management, IT, and programming. I spent this semester working on a wide variety of projects on a team with 2 other interns, learning many valuable lessons. Here's a short summary:

* Re-designed tool in C# to automate domain migration process used on over 7,000 operation critical computers. The tool involves AES encryption for credentials, multiple UIâ€™s, web services, and a background windows service
* Developed C# application with database connection allowing Aviation IT personnel to edit PC registry settings
* Wrote VBA modules to process data and communicate results automatically to ~200 employees

#### Kinetic Vision (June 2015 - December 2015)

My first internship was with a company called Kinetic Vision in Cincinnati. This company is unique; it's mid-sized, but a large portion of its workforce are actually interns from my university. This means that I got some real, direct work experience and a large amount of responsibility. I learned many valuable skills over the semester!

* Produced a VB module for 3d modeling program to perform specific object transforms using vector calculus
* Designed and constructed multiple small UIs and one enterprise-level UI in PySide
* Contributed additions to in-house Python UI library to streamline creation of UIs and provide design standards
