title: 'Co-Ops'
---

At the University of Cincinnati, we do Co-Ops every other semester. I've gotten the chance to work at some great companies, so here are my experiences from most to least recent!

#### Intuit, San Diego
##### (May 2018 - August 2018)

During the summer of 2018, I had the opportunity to work with Intuit on a security team. The experience was absolutely amazing, not only because I was fortunate to be in San Diego, but because of the people and company. My team was going through some organizational changes at the time which meant less programming time as compared to other co-ops, however, I learned a great deal about how security is structured at an enterprise level (especially in such a vital area with financial data). In addition, I gained a large amount of experience with AWS and GCP, with special considerations in relation to security. 

* Analyzed security-related data with python to assist in identifying candidates for root cause analysis investigations 
* Compiled results of data analysis into a sustainable dashboard and concrete items to address for security 
* Obtained training on GCP and AWS and their security considerations to educate teams on security policies 
* Participated in strategic planning sessions and contributed ideas towards the future of security 

#### GE Aviation, Grand Rapids
##### (August 2017 - December 2017)

Being a Computer Engineering undergrad, I get excited about hardware. Getting the chance to work with the avionics inside the 777x jet, then, was a fascinating and challenging experience. My role was to be a Systems Engineering intern, performing integration and verification, which meant spending a lot of time in the lab with the hardware. Here are some highlights:

* Integrated computing systems for the Boeing 777x commercial jet within lab environment
* Streamlined common lab processes through automation with C# and Python, saving hours of time for engineers
* Wrote 5 formal verification procedures to be run for credit when the system is ready for testing
* Planned and produced formal testing library in Python for automating verification procedures
* Gained ownership of ensuring legacy C++ testing tool worked and made additions to codebase


#### GE Aviation, Evendale
##### (January 2016 - May 2016)

In this role, I was a Digital Technology Leadership Program Intern. GE has various after-schoool programs, one being DTLP which is focused on some intersection between management, IT, and programming. I spent this semester working on a wide variety of projects on a team with 2 other interns, learning many valuable lessons. Here's a short summary:

* Re-designed tool in C# to automate domain migration process used on over 7,000 operation critical computers. The tool involves AES encryption for credentials, multiple UIâ€™s, web services, and a background windows service
* Developed C# application with database connection allowing Aviation IT personnel to edit PC registry settings
* Wrote VBA modules to process data and communicate results automatically to ~200 employees

#### Kinetic Vision
##### (June 2015 - December 2015)

My first internship was with a company called Kinetic Vision in Cincinnati. This company is unique; it's mid-sized, but a large portion of its workforce are actually interns from my university. This means that I got some real, direct work experience and a large amount of responsibility. I learned many valuable skills over the semester!

* Produced a VB module for 3d modeling program to perform specific object transforms using vector calculus
* Designed and constructed multiple small UIs and one enterprise-level UI in PySide
* Contributed additions to in-house Python UI library to streamline creation of UIs and provide design standards
