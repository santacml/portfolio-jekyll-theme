I'm currently working towards a Master's in Computer Science (with a Computer Engineering undergrad). To this end, I am doing research to use neural networks for malware detection.

I will be updating this page soon. Unfortunately, the research itself is confidential until the work is published. I have one conference publication coming out soon (proceedings from NAECON), and I'm hoping to get a journal publication soon as well!
