At UC, I was able to do a Bachelor's and a Master's of Science in Computer Engineering. For the thesis, did research on using neural networks for malware detection. I found that I absolutely love research - it is some of the most rewarding work I have ever done.

#### Neural Classification of Malware-As-Video with Considerations for In-Hardware Inferencing
##### M.S. Thesis

If you're interested in my work I highly recommend downloading my M.S. thesis, available [for free here](http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=ucin1554216974556897). It's the most complete and organized work I've written both in terms of my research and in terms of, well, everything I've ever done. The other papers I've written were cut out of the context of the broader picture and therefore, in my opinion, provide value but leave a lot of unanswered questions. Even if there is only one section that interests you, I'd recommend going straight to it and treating the other sections as possible answers to other questions that come up.

I thoroughly enjoyed the process of assembling the work for, and writing, a thesis! 

#### NAECON 2018

We were fortunate to present a paper on neural network saliency and its relation to malware detection at NAECON 2018! The paper should be out in a couple months, and I will update this page then.

#### Detecting Malicious Assembly using Convolutional, Recurrent Neural Networks
##### ASTESJ

ASTESJ invited us to write a paper extending our work done in the NAECON 2017 paper, which was our first neural network attempt. I'd like to discuss the journal itself. If one searches ASTESJ they will find some accusations of misconduct/unethical publishing, which was worrisome for me especially as someone young in their career. After consideration, we decided to write a paper on the recurrent neural networks we attempted to use for malware detection, which is available [here for free](https://astesj.com/v04/i05/p06/). 

There are not many papers using recurrent neural networks in this way - our (my) intention was not to get an easy publish, but to contribute some information that would not go into other papers we submit and be otherwise assumed knowledge without justification. I've been apprehensive about the journal, however, all my interactions with the journal were professional, the other papers in the journal seem credible, and others vouch for the integrity of the journal. Therefore, my conclusion at the moment is that the journal is simply young and still growing.

In my eyes, the work should speak for itself, regardless of the journal it appears in. This paper was important for establishing that while recurrent neural networks can work for this solution, they are not at all necessary or optimal. I'm happy with how the paper came out!

#### Detecting Malicious Assembly with Deep Learning
##### NAECON 2017

Work began for my research by replicating the results of others with a simple approach, and the first paper we wrote based on that work was presented at NAECON in 2017. The paper is available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8556657).

There are honestly a multitude of things I would change about that first paper. If I could rewrite it, I would tie in more sources, better present the results of the paper as the figures are lacking, more thoroughly test the networks in various ways, and re-word large portions of it for clarity. At the same time, everyone starts somewhere and I'm glad to have been able to write that conference paper at all. I learned much from this paper and believe that the results of that learning can be seen in the works above.
