I'm currently working towards a Master's in Computer Science (with a Computer Engineering undergrad). To this end, I am doing research to use neural networks for malware detection. More and more I am finding that I absolutely love research - it is some of the most rewarding work I have ever done.

We have just published our first research paper, available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8556657) and the code is on Github! I am beyond excited that we were able to present our work at NAECON.

Since then, a LOT of work has been done to expand on that paper, and I hope to publish a full journal article soon!

Because of funding rules, I can't post much information at the moment. As things get cleared, I will post much more!
